# Usability log

What a planner hits when using the app for real, found by building companies from an empty dataset through the
screens (not by opening the prepared examples). Each entry: what happened, why it matters, and what was done.
Open items name the roadmap phase that addresses them.

Phases: **A** get your own company in · **B** master-data depth · **C** capacity and material together ·
**D** PP/DS-class scheduling · **E** procure-to-pay.

## Found in the reality check (before Phase A)

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | A new transport lane starts with no mode; the engine rejected it and the whole dataset became unreadable ("List should have at least 1 item…"). New demand rows had the same trap. | Critical | **Fixed (A).** Unfinished records are set aside with a plain reason and the rest keeps planning (`engine/scp/validate/lenient.py`); new lanes start with a truck mode and single-choice references are pre-filled. |
| R2 | No way to build a network: 22 unordered tables, six of them needed in the right order for one product. | Critical | **Fixed (A).** *Set up*: places and routes (click two places on the map to connect them), products, and a product wizard (made here from these parts on this line / bought from / shipped from, plus stock and ordering rules). |
| R3 | No file format for demand (or anything): only forms or one whole-company JSON. | Critical | **Fixed (A).** Every table uploads from CSV, Excel (.xlsx) or pasted cells, with a template, a preview of what is added, updated or skipped and why, names accepted for ids, and one-click creation of missing products. BOM lines and routing steps upload in long format. |
| R4 | The Demand page ignored entered demand ("customers will order 0"). | Critical | **Fixed (A).** *Demand plan* is the first tab: product × place × week, editable in place, with upload; the forecast is one way to fill it. |
| R5 | The data check said "Ready to plan" with no demand or sources; it spoke in codes (`LOCATION_PRODUCT_DEFAULTED`). | Critical | **Fixed (A).** A "What's missing" checklist in setup order, each line with its button (`engine/scp/validate/setup.py`); rules shown by plain title, records by name. |
| R6 | Shop floor said every run finishes on time while the supply plan had the parts arriving late. | Critical | **Stated (A), fixed in C.** The Shop floor answer now says it assumes the parts are there when the supply plan has late inbound supply. Material-aware scheduling is Phase C. |
| R7 | Home said "the forecast is 100% accurate" with no history, and "All 1 measures". | Serious | **Fixed (A).** |
| R8 | A raw engine message: "STOCKOUT (1) … worst 1,000.0", without product or place. | Serious | **Fixed (A).** Translated, with product and place; no exception code can reach the page untranslated. |
| R9 | Master-data search count wrapped onto three lines. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** |
| R10 | "Plan everything" lit up when there was nothing to plan. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** It stays plain until the checklist has nothing left to do. |

## Found while building Phase A

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | Saving a version with an unfinished record would be refused by the version store with a schema error. | Serious | **Fixed (A).** Saving is disabled with a plain reason and a link to the records to finish. |
| N2 | The Capacity plan said "the network can supply all of demand" while the supply plan had 43% on time. The monthly model cannot see lead times shorter than a month. | Serious | **Stated (A).** The answer says "month by month" and names the day-by-day on-time figure when they differ. A capacity-and-time consistent plan is Phase C. |
| N3 | The forecast tab showed an empty dashboard ("0 series", "0 units") and an active "Use this forecast" button when there was no history. | Serious | **Fixed (A).** It explains what a forecast needs and points to the demand plan. |
| N4 | Readiness hints used planner-internal words (location-product, node, horizon, L4L). | Serious | **Fixed (A).** Rewritten in plain words; the link opens the product's setup page. |
| N5 | The network map led with ids (SUPPLIER-A) instead of names. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** |
| N6 | Data-check problems for a product at a place that has no planning record linked to a record that does not exist. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** Links to that product's setup page, where the record is made. |
| N7 | A company with no opening stock gets 11 purchase orders "should already have started" on day one. True, but alarming for a first plan. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** Home says the plan starts every place from zero and links to entering today's stock. |
| N8 | Forecast records that cover a month are shown spread over its weeks by calendar days, while the engine spreads them over working days. Totals agree; single weeks can differ slightly. | Minor | Open (documented in the grid's code). |
| N10 | Opening *Set up* before the first data check had answered froze the page (a selector returned a new empty list on every render). Found only at phone width, where the page opened first. | Critical | **Fixed (A).** |
| N11 | At phone width the places and routes tables ran past their panel. | Minor | **Fixed (A).** |
| N9 | Lanes created by the wizard carry all products. Right for most companies, but a lane for one product needs Master data. | Minor | Open (Phase B: lane products in the wizard). |

## Gaps against SAP recorded for later phases

- MRP views: no MRP controller or MRP group, no special procurement keys, no scheduling margin key, no single
  "material at plant" screen with MRP 1–4 tabs (**B**).
- Work centres: one start hour for all, no named shifts, breaks or capacity that changes over time (**B**).
- BOM and routing: no alternatives, phantoms, co-products, engineering change, overlap or subcontracting (**B**).
- Capacity: no levelling view, no capacity-constrained MRP, scheduling ignores material (**C**).
- PP/DS: one heuristic and a short local search; no strategy profiles, heuristics catalogue, real optimiser or
  drag-and-drop board (**D**).
- MM: no vendor master, info records, source lists, requisitions, POs or goods-receipt documents (**E**).
